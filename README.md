# Edu2Job – Predicting Job Roles from Educational Background

## Project Overview
Edu2Job is a machine learning project developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Internship (Batch 3)**.  
The goal is to predict suitable **job roles** based on a candidate’s **educational qualification, experience, and skills**.

---

## Milestone 1 – Dataset & EDA
- **Dataset Source:** Kaggle – `candidate_job_role_dataset`
- **Tasks Completed:**
  - Data Cleaning (duplicates, missing values, normalization)
  - Feature extraction (`num_skills`, `qualification_course`)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib

**Cleaned file:** `cleaned_job_roles.csv`  
**Notebook:** `milestone1_EDA.ipynb`

---

## Milestone 2 – Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical features (qualification, experience_level, etc.)
- Standardized numerical columns
- Feature Selection
- Split data into train and test sets

## Milestone 3 – Model Training and Evaluation

**Machine Learning Models Used**
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Tree Classifier
-Random Forest Classifier
-Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-XGBoost Classifier

**Techniques Applied**

**1️.Cross-Validation:**
To ensure reliability and reduce bias, k-Fold Cross Validation (k=5) was applied to assess each model’s performance consistency across different splits.

**2️.Regularization:**
Regularization techniques were applied to control overfitting by limiting model complexity
Logistic Regression: Used L2 regularization
Random Forest: Reduced max_depth, max_features, and increased min_samples_split
XGBoost: Tuned gamma, reg_alpha, and reg_lambda parameters

**3️.Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV):**
To identify optimal hyperparameters efficiently, RandomizedSearchCV was applied to XGBoost and Random Forest models to achieve better generalization and balanced accuracy.

## Milestone 3 – EDU2JOB Prediction App
- **XGBoost** - best model
- **Streamlit** – for the web interface  
- **SQLite3** – for storing user and prediction data  
- **Scikit-learn / Joblib** – for machine learning model handling
## 🚀 Features

- Predicts top 3 job roles based on user profile  
- Uses trained ML model (`best_model.pkl`) for prediction  
- Stores user data using SQLite
- Simple and interactive Streamlit web interface  
- Modular design with separate database helper file (`db_helper.py`)
- Admin Dashboard
