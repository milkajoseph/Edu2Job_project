# Edu2Job – Predicting Job Roles from Educational Background

## Project Overview
Edu2Job is a machine learning project developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Internship (Batch 3)**.  
The goal is to predict suitable **job roles** based on a candidate’s **educational qualification, experience, and skills**.

---

## Milestone 1 – Dataset & EDA
- **Dataset Source:** Kaggle – `candidate_job_role_dataset`
- **Tasks Completed:**
  - Data Cleaning (duplicates, missing values, normalization)
  - Feature extraction (`num_skills`, `qualification_course`)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib

**Cleaned file:** `cleaned_job_roles.csv`  
**Notebook:** `milestone1_EDA.ipynb`

---

## Milestone 2 – Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical features (qualification, experience_level, etc.)
- Standardized numerical columns
- Feature Selection
- Split data into train and test sets
